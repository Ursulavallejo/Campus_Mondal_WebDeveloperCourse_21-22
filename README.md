  ## As part of the Web Development course — Mölndal Campus, Sweden


## Data Learning ( Datalarning) >> 

1. AssigmentMongoDB_Node_Mongoose >
 
   Built a MongoDB-backed REST API and used it to power a React-based TODO application.
   MongoDB/Node/Mongoose backend, React TODO front-end prototype, UX design, and end-to-end testing.

2. assigment_MySQL >
   
    Implemented a full MySQL database workflow for a bookstore application:

  - Schema design: Created authors, categories and books tables with appropriate primary keys and foreign‐key relationships.
  - Data seeding: Populated each table with sample entries for authors, categories and book records.
  - SQL operations: Executed CREATE, DROP and USE statements; wrote INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE queries to manage and verify data.
  - Advanced queries: Developed JOIN queries (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) to combine authors, books and categories; filtered results by category or author; and demonstrated ordering     and transaction control.

## Digital Creation ( Digital Skapande ) >> 

  A personal web-based narrative project using HTML, multimedia (video, GIF, audio) and AR filters to tell seven sensory-driven stories of a child with autism, designed via     waterfall planning and documented step-by-step.

## Interface Design ( Gränssnittsdesign ) >> 

   Redesigned a fishing club website with a Trello-driven plan, four user personas, low- and high-fidelity wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop), a cohesive font and color       scheme, and detailed UI/UX documentation.

  ## Programming 1 ( Programmering_1 ) >> 

  Built a Trello-planned music CD store with HTML/CSS/JavaScript: dynamic cart UI, quantity controls, free-shipping logic, and full CRUD interaction.

  ## Programming 1 ( WebbserverProgrammering_1 ) >> 

  Built on our earlier MongoDB/Mongoose foundations, this project splits into two parts:

  - Backend: An Express.js API with CORS, Helmet & Morgan middleware, connected to MongoDB, fully tested with Mocha, Chai & chai-http.

  - Frontend: Two React-based TODO apps—one minimal CRUD interface and a second with user login/auth flows—showcasing dynamic data fetching, context management, and live         updates.

    Key learnings included middleware setup, end-to-end testing, handling React state refreshes vs. full page reloads, and overcoming async data-flow challenges.

  ## Web Development 1 ( Webbutveckling_1) >> 

   My first foray into web building: created a six-page site (About, Courses, Home, Blog, Products, Other) with a consistent header/nav/footer layout, responsive CSS via         media queries, and Trello-driven planning to manage each HTML/CSS milestone.

   ## Web Development 2 ( Webbutveckling_2) >> 

   In the Web Development 2 project, I took my Programming 1 music store app and rebuilt it entirely in React. I rewrote that vanilla‐JS app in React: swapped manual DOM         updates for JSX components, introduced client‐side routing (react-router), and moved cart state into a Context provider instead of simple arrays. It’s the same core         functionality—add/remove/update items—but now powered by a full React architecture.
