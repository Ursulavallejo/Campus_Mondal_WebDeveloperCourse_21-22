2. assigment_MySQL >
   
Implemented a full MySQL database workflow for a bookstore application:

- Schema design: Created authors, categories and books tables with appropriate primary keys and foreign‐key relationships.
- Data seeding: Populated each table with sample entries for authors, categories and book records.
- SQL operations: Executed CREATE, DROP and USE statements; wrote INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE queries to manage and verify data.
- Advanced queries: Developed JOIN queries (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) to combine authors, books and categories; filtered results by category or author; and demonstrated ordering and transaction control.
