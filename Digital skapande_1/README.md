# 1. General Project :

For develop the project I used the waterfall method for clear up the general idea and be able to develop a diagram for what will be included on the project and how I plan to develop it.

### Method for develop the project:

![](img/waterfallmetod.png)

### Phase 1: Planning

On the first phase of the project have tried to do an analysis of what are the requirements for a digital project. The different options to develop a project using for example photos, videos, animation , sound or text for example.
On that stage I realized that was important for me to have first and  idea to work for, and after trying to find which method for production I should use to express myself.

As we don't have any parameters of what topic we should use as the main idea , and we can choose what  better suit for us to develop in the project, I decided to make it a little more personal. That way has and adds  value to me. I thought that I could try to make the effort to transmit something that is important and near for me, as is having your child diagnosed with Autism.

After I decided I would like to do the project based on my son I did a brainstorm of what topics can work with, what element's on his development were different compared with other kids, and how I can define him nowadays.

![](img/brainstorm.jpg)

On a first stage after doing the brainstorm thought that would like to do a video to narrate and history based on my son's development, and what he has reached. Also try to transmit the idea to don't let anyone put boundaries to kids, as we all are in certain way different from each other, and these particularities most be seen as and different way to approach the reality, and  as power they have, that in certain way makes them stronger. I see my son proudly as a warrior or superhero that every day has taught me the truly important value of things in life and to never give up and to fight to be a better person.

As my plan was to do a narration with different aspects, my first approach was to think on a video, as is the most common used tool nowadays to describe what going on in our daily lives. For example: instagram, facebook and YouTube. And for been able to create a narrative my fist taught was the video as was the nearest, but after the selection of the items would like to include in the project, I thought that as well a tool as a webpage can also work for that purpose. Also adding that at the moment im studying the course of web development and believed was more pertinent to try to express my idea of the narrative of my son through that media.

After the brainstorm I took 7 main ideas that could implement in my project as are some particularities with the kids with ASD( Autism spectrum disorder), related with the perception of the environment as: 
-sensitivity to the sound.
-sensitivity to strong smells.
-Problems with some textures with the food.

 And other behaviour or cognitive aspects as:
- Place their toys in order.
- Communication, as usually have delay at speaking need pictograms (images) in most of the cases.

Other aspects related with that how I perceive my son nowadays:
- As a loving boy.
- Have different interest and learn a lot of them as mathematics, dinosaurs, solar system, natur, fishing and Minecraft.

### Phase 2: Design

On the second stage of the project, once the idea of the project was clear and knew with aspects would like to work on it,  I started to try to create a diagram or a draft of how I would like to create a layout for the webpage that you can see below:


### Diagram projektet :

![](img/projektDigitalSkapande.jpg)

### Main concept for the  HTML page:

As the idea was to generate a narration around few aspects of my son, and him as a superhero, decide that I would like to use a layout where he is in the center of attention of the web page as a superhero and the different narrations surround him and are in loop so anyone can read visually them in any stage.
To make sure that someone is able to understand what I would like to transmit, and that also is able to create  the different relations with the images that are showed in the webpage, I decide to include a sound on the page with a narration, a story that I wrote using the perspective of a boy that narrates how was his development, and describes the power his moms sees on him.
The seven narratives of those aspects I select previously, decided that would like them to be dynamic, that the general project has some movement that's why I decide that would use video and gif format on them. More playful as has relation with a childhood that learn concepts through playing.
For each narrative try to visualice the main concept to figure out the approach that better suit for generate that content, and image that describe the idea. This will be explained ahead in the documentation, where I describe each of the seven ideas.

### Phase 3: Development

To be able to start with this phase it was needed  to have a draft of what would like to have on the webpage (layout) and the concept of the project.  I planned a time frame to  have time to create all the content need it. 
Each  visual content was based on the analysis that was done previously, on how express each of the seven narratives on the formats that I choose as video and gif. After these was ready I was able to start with the process of creation of the content to create the general project.
At the same time that I was working on this process tried to keep a record of the stages I followed in the creation, to be able to describe the digital creative process that was needed it for the course of  'Digital Skapande'.
The process I followed and the information on this developing process could be read more in detail on the documentation part, as each process is described there.

### Phase 4: Launch, testing

The deadline we had for the project count as the launch of product. Once that I ensamble all the pieces on the webpage was needed to control that they were actually working.  On this stage  also worked  in the last adjustments of the CSS to change the size och each narration and see that actually the composition of the web page have a good balance between the elements  and the same time give the feeling to be dynamic. 
Once this was double-checked and adjust, I was able to launch my project.

See the final project below:

# 2. Documentation  :

On this part we can see all the process involved on the creation of the different elements that are included on the webpage.  Include also information regarding this main questions:

* What tools have you used and why?
* What do you portray with your work?
* How did the process of creating your production work?

### Different parts of the project:

## Step 1: HTML

The tools that was used in this step was Webstorm to be able to create a webpage that contain the general project. 
The aspects were taking in consideration were:

- Create a Layout :
In the head a Typography  with the title.
A main image in the center to call the attention of the eye , in this case will be the boy superhero.
Around main image the other narratives. Create  balance between them, as are 7 should be placed 2 on each side and 3 under.

- Have a sound that is the history of the boy. 

- A button where we open a drop menu, and we can read the story.

### About the process:

* What tools have you used and why?

To be able to configurate the webpage I used Webstorm to create the HTML and include the content I created to illustrate the narrative of the idea of my project. The type of formats used are video, gif, sound and image(.mov,.gif,.png and .mp4). 
- I used this format as was posible to show different narrations at the same time and make them perceive more dynamic for the person that has access to them. 

* What do you portray with your work?

  With this I want to transmit that many kids face a different development on his life, that  every kid is not the same and that those differences  can also be seen as strengths.  A boy that is a superhero for his mother, as he showed to her that those particulates  are a power to approach the world in a different way and that sometimes people put limits of what others can learn, and they shouldn't do so. Fight for been a  better person and let the others have opportunities to evolve in life.

* How did the process of creating your production work?

- First work in creating the general layout of the project using only some image for configurate the position and the functions inside the web page.
- Check the video play automatically and do a loop. The new version of Chrome only show videos that are muted so for been able to know this checked few forum as was not working for me.
- On the audio test that we can add it to the web and the format that work with it. In this step saw the need to transform the M4a format witch  the iphone's used by default  and convert it to a mp3;  the audio control do not handle the original format of the iphone's.
- create the CSS style for been able to place and organice the elements accordingly with the diagram of the idea that I did on the first phase. Using a Grid to place the elements on place.
- See that actually teh autoplay of the audio was disturbing me reason that make me see that is better that the user has the option to start it when interact with the page.
- create a Javascript script to be able to have a dropdown menu that opens and close where the text of the audio can be found.
- Once the final elements are ready was able to change the ones as used on the draft of the HTML for the final ones .
- Test that the web is working properly and lat adjustments on the place of the elements on the layout if the webpage.

See below the draft of the process:

Final Layout:  !!!!!
 


## Step 2: Central Main image 

The original idea was to create and animation for the photos of the superhero that I took for that purpose but after creating the draft of the HTML realice that visually was not necessary. All the other content involve movement and saw  that if the center one was still will be like the anchor of the rest of the images and the idea was that all the other histories are related to that one, reason I  decided that actually was better that center superhero image stay still as work as an anchor for the other ones. 


### About the process:

* What tools have you used and why?

- For the production of this narration was needed a camera and a photo-editor. 
  The first idea was to create a gif for that reason I shoot several pictures but afterwards decide was better to keep the main image still as an ankor for the rest of the histories on the web page.  As I would like to keep the idea to use homemade costume as a superhero,  emphasize the iconography of the comics ( stars coming from the background as wonder woman posters) and change the red color of the superhero cape. For that reason was needed it a photo editor. I decided to use Photoshop as im used to work with that  program and like the different type of brushes and edition option that we can implement. 
- The original photo was created with my son that is the main character and try different position to try to find an angle that shows as him with the arm extended and a hand made costume as they were playing in the house to make it more natural and close to everyone.

The image of wonder woman were taken the idea of the stars.

![](img/wonderwoman.png)

* What do you portray with your work? 

With the picture want to transmit that my son is a superhero for me.  Select to use a homemade costume with regular things we have at home as is a daily home game and not posing for a scene. Taking a more natural context that anyone can see on his daily life   while kids are playing at home. On my daily life my son is my superhero.

* How did the process of creating your production work?

- first I used a camera to shoot a serie of photos as the original idea was to used them to create a gif. In total around 3 sets of 80 photos were shot for that purpose.
- After the decision to maintain this main image still I overlook all the ones I had and select one to work on.
- The image was imported to Photoshop where I:
1. remove the background to have it transparent ( that way integrate better on the web page).
2. Balance the colors on the image.
3. Amplify the image to remove the white pixels on the contour of the image.
4. Duplicate the image and delete all content, except the area that I would like to change the color to red.
5. Have the idea to add a mask but actually decided to keep the original as he used swim glasses . Usually kids plays to dress that way to play so decided to keep it as is their own way to express.
6. After I draw some starts with a brush to try to make relation with the comic iconography of the superheros. For example the wonder woman.
7. Export the images as png to keep the transparent background.

Some images from the process:

![](img/superheromain2.jpg)
![](img/draftMainMask.png)
![](img/olivermainsuperh.png)

## Step 3: Text Head

For the letters that I plan to have as main tittle want to keep a relation with the idea of a superhero. This topic is mainly viewed in comic magazines reason  decide to use a Typography inspired on the superheros comics. Have something more specific typography and not a standar one in HTML.

### About the process:

* What tools have you used and why?

As I decide to use a specific typography that I search it on internet need to use some image-editor to be able to transform it with the content I need it. For that purpose I used Photoshop to modify the typography.

* What do you portray with your work?

With that typography want to transmit a relation with the comic books, make it more specific and not a generic font-letter found in a library of the HTML. Follow the main idea of the project and create a relation with the content on it, for example the main photo of teh superhero and the typography used on comic book with that topic.

* How did the process of creating your production work?

- On a first instance try to find some images on the web with different typographies that could work to transmit the idea of the comic books and the overall text of the title.
I found the following two images to work:

![](img/originaltitle.png)
![](img/mamas%20text%20web.jpg)

-I import them to photoshop:
For the Superhältar image: Was needed it to retouch and remove elements on the image. After duplicate one letter and place it at the end to have the correct text that I need it. At the end place drawing filter to try to have the sense of more kids drawing  and not only a vektor drawing. And place it on a transparent background in format png.
For the Mamas text, delete the text was not need it. Duplicate the letter need it to create the title and place it on a transparent background. At the end distort the angle of the text to be more dynamic.

 You can see the  original above  and transformation below:

![](img/title%20superhero1.png)

![](img/titleMama.png)
![](img/title%20superhero.png)


## Step 4: Text and sound

On the webpage the idea was to have a history narrated from the kid's perspective. This is included  for  let user  understand the whole project and the different relations that take place on the  narratives. The audio and text explain the connections that are inside the project. The audio and the text are the same.

The page include:
- Control for the sound below him.
- Button that open the text to be read.

![](img/iconsound.png)

### About the process:

* What tools have you used and why?

For create and the audio and the text was needed it to use a Text editor as Word , a microphone, audio recorder device and an audio-editing tool.
The text was worked in Word to be able to have a draft adn be translated to swedish. Also work to have already in a digital version to be copy and paste it on the HTML dropmenu in the project.
The history was taped with a microphone on the iPhone and used it on Audacity to modify the acoustic and include some background sound to the history. 

* What do you portray with your work?

With the Audio and the text want the viewer to be able to understand why I see my son as a superhero. All the different aspect on his development and hear the story as he was telling it to them.  

* How did the process of creating your production work?

- First I focus to work in a history related  with the experience of the grown upp of my son as the following topics:  Particularities of the kids that have Autism. 
The reason why mom see him as a superhero. 
 After all the difficulties he is loving child that have a lot of interests and how have taught us as  parents at never give upp and don't let anyone  put boundaries for what he can do.
  For that I wrote the particularities he had when was lite and are common for autism and at the end was make him what he is know ... how he has evolved and identify him.
  Have select 7 different aspects to show in the history and each has a gif or video that reflectes it but all are part of the main history that is played with the narrative in the sound.
- The draft was written in spanish as is my mother language, and after I was happy with the narration the second step was to translated to swedish with help of my husband to keep the essence of the text.
- I record a first draft with the text in spanish to test how sound the audio with the iphone and see how can reduce some possible noise at the background.
- Did 3 different records of teh voice of my husband to see which one had better sound quality. At the end choose one.
- The audio track that I choose need to be transformed from m4a to and mp3 format. Reason I use an online converter to do it.
- Imported to Audacity (audio editor) and import the background music that I choose from an audio library to create some atmosphere to the history.
- After I exported and included on the draft I have created on the HTML web page.

### Text Narrative Spanish: (first Draft)

No hace mucho tiempo atrás, mi realidad era muy diferente.
A los 2 años fui diagnosticado con autismo.
¿Pero qué significa esto?
Muchas personas lo ven como una discapacidad, pero es una forma diferente de relacionarse con el mundo.

Cuando era pequeño me molestaba mucho ir de compras a tiendas de ropa, allí ponen música muy alta y me ponía muy nervioso.
En el bus, me afectaban los olores fuertes, como el de los perfumes. No los aguantaba, y me tocaba bajarme del bus y esperar al próximo.
A la hora de comer, me molestaban mucho las diferentes texturas de los alimentos, como el de las frutas y no lograba comerlas.
Hasta los 4 años, hablaba muy poco y me costaba mucho enfocar mi atención en alguien.
Al jugar, me gustaba mucho hacerlo solo y poner en orden repetitivo mis juguetes.
Estos son rasgos característicos de los niños con autismo, por si no lo sabías.
Ahora tengo 7 años y muchas de esas cosas las he ido dejando atrás. Bueno, aún no logro comer trozos de fruta; me da vueltas la cabeza al intentarlo. También me gusta que la gente siga las normas, o ¿para qué están hechas?

Mis padres me dicen que yo soy capaz de hacer lo que quiera, de aprender y ser una buena persona.
Que siempre intente primero como me siento al hacer las cosas que me interesan, antes de decir que no puedo. Y nunca creer a los que intentan ponerme barreras a lo que puedo llegar a hacer.

Para mi mamá soy su superhéroe, porque día a día se emociona al verme crecer y evolucionar. Al ver todos los intereses que tengo; de como me apasiono por un tema e indago hasta conocer muchos aspectos de él. A mí me gustan mucho las matemáticas, los dinosaurios, ir a pescar con mi papá y puedo identificar que pez ha picado. Actualmente me interesa mucho Minecraft y hablo mucho de todo lo que se puede construir allí.

Tengo un superpoder especial, el de dar mucho cariño, otro de poder contar todas esas cosas que me interesan y enseñarlas a mis amigos. Explicarlas en español a mamá y en sueco a papá.

Soy el superhéroe de mamá, y ella me enseña que nunca debo dejar de creer en mis superpoderes. Porque cada persona es única e importante.

## Step 5: Seven narratives related with the story

### 1. Sensitive to sound:

One of the characteristics of the kids with autism are that they are sensitive to sound. Usually they get overwhelmed as they get overstimulated in situations with load music or noise; reason they get upset and nervous . In many cases they touch their ears or used headphones that stop the sound.

![](img/soundSen.png)

### About the process:

* What tools have you used and why?
For this part of the story I used the app of instagram. There you can search for different filters and also choose between different format for create media ( video, loops, reels and also include specific audio or text).
See instagram as a tool were many people express what they are going through on their daily life. Influencers and companies get a lot of attention. They use the tools that instagram offer and help them to create different narratives depending on the purpose want to approach.  
I see part of the story that im telling on my projects as a diary, that we  can compare with the histories on instagram reason I decide to introduce on my project what a tools as instagram can offer to us in as digital narrative.
* Also used a video editor as Shotcut to remove the sound and be able to have other format as the gif . (Instagram create video as .mov)

* What do you portray with your work?

With this  video want to capture the moment where the kid of the story needed to put the hands on his ears to stop all the external impute ( lyric notes) that surround him. A reaction to the music that is not a pleasure to him on the contrary trigger discomfort to him.

* How did the process of creating your production work?

On a first instance did research of the different option that offer instagram to create media. The filters of virtual reality that can be found and how they work.
Found interesting that not necessary the content need to be published can be saved on your device. That way you can export it to other programs to edit them or place it in other context as I did in using it on my webpage project.
For my video decide to use a responsive filter as they track the movement of the person in front of teh camera, and it's modify with the interaction ( music notes that are generated with the movements of the face).
To capture the idea of the kid getting overwhelmed with the music notes, was needed it to shoot the video 5 times. The first time the light  of the room was darker  and in other occasions  the composition of the image was not creating the atmosphere that was looking for.
Once I got the shot as .mov format  I imported also to Shotcut video editor to delete the audio and create a gif.  On the web used the .mov and on the markdown the gif.

### 3. Toys in order:

![](img/toys.png)

### About the process:
* What tools have you used and why?

For create this narrative on the project was used a camera, tripod, shot remote-control, a program to edit photos as Gimp.
The idea was to generate a sequencer of cars that follow some order, to be able to create that felling, choose better to do a gif as on a video don't have the felling to be in different frames that's come one after the other, but a gift as is slower and get the sense that cut every images one after the other.   To have that effect on the narration was the reason decide that a gif worked better as the cars follow an order and are following each other by place them in the space.

* What do you portray with your work?

On this narrative what to capture the idea of order, that constantly keep the same pattern as the kid the with autism follow when they play.

* How did the process of creating your production work?

For create the gif was needed to took around 60-80 photos to create the felling that  the elements  follow some order and create a dynamic of movement with them.

![](img/registroToys.JPG)

For been able to have a gif that worked for me, was needed it to shoot the series of photos  3 times as the previous ones saw thinks that actually was not working to create the sense I want with them.

On the first try realized that I didn't like it the distribution of the lines of the cars on the space and how the size of the cars was showed, that the reason why I decided to do another shoot with a different composition. 
![](img/draftToys.gif)

On the next shoot realize that the order that the object disappear on the sequence didn't feel like they were following one after the other reason I decide to change the order that they disappear on the screen, to have the same pattern as they were placed on first instance.

Once I had the sequencer of photos that worked for the project I used Gimp editor to  adjust the light of the photos and create a gif with the animation filter. At the end was exported making the frame interval lite slower as the one comes by default ( the ones  selected was 180 frames to be able to see the cars, the other was fast.)

### 6. Loving kid:

On this part of teh project want to narrate that my son has accomplished to be able to express love surround him. Kids with autism have difficult to create relations with others but in the case of my son he is a really loving boy that cares os the people that surround him. What to transmit of that kindness / love he gives to the others in this video.

### About the process:

* What tools have you used and why?

For this part of the story I used the app of instagram. There you can search for different filters and also choose between different format for create media ( video, loops, reels and also include specific audio or text).

- Also used a video editor as Shotcut to remove the sound and be able to have other format as the gif . (Instagram create video as .mov)

* What do you portray with your work?

Want to capture a moment that a kid is able to express love as he kisses his panda bear. An intimate moment with someone he loves.
Symbolises tender love that can be found on the kids.

* How did the process of creating your production work?

On a first instance did research of the different option that offer instagram to create media. The filters of virtual reality that can be found and how they work.
For this video decide to use a  background animation ( hearts in movement around the kid  and the teddy bear ).
To capture the idea of the kid hugging with love the panda needed to shoot the video 3 times to get the correct angle. As didn't want the face of the kids be the one calling the attention, what I want to emphasize was the action between the two of them. Show only part of the face, over the shoulder was a better option for this purpose.
Once I got the shot as .mov format  I imported also to Shotcut video editor to delete the audio and create a gif.  On the web used the .mov and on the markdown the gif.
