        <h2>Foster home</h2>
        <p>Fostering a dog is an incredibly rewarding experience that really makes you grow as a person. The difference you can make through fostering is immeasurable.Here are some things you should know before taking in a foster:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> You need to ensure that you have the time, energy, and money to look after a dog until they find their forever home. Your lifestyle may have to change.</li>
            <li>You might be a dog’s first ever home and each dog will have different training needs, like how to walk on a leash or be alone without getting anxious. </li>
            <li>Make sure your home is suitable and safe for a dog, and please check with your landlord first. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The thought of having a new bestie is super exciting, but make sure you consider everything thoroughly. Ask the shelter for information about the dog’s personality/needs, so that you and the dog can have the best possible experience. Communication is key and you need to make sure it’s right for you too. </p>
